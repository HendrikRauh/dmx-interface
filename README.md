## üì± Implemented microcontrollers

-   [x] Lolin S2 mini
-   [ ] ESP 32 WROOM
-   [ ] ESP 32 C3

> For other microcontrollers you may need to adjust the `platformio.ini`

## üîå Wiring

You have to short-circuit `R0` on the RS485 boards to enable the termination resistor required for DMX before the first and after the last device in line.

## üì¶ Case

All print files (STL, STEP, X_T) can be found in [assets/case](/assets/case/). Alternatively you can view the project on [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/7363818fd18bf0cbf094790e/w/52455282b39e47fbde5d0e53/e/9bec98aa83a813dc9a4d6ab2) where you can export the files in a format you like.

| LED                               | Description               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ![off](/assets/led/off.gif)       | no power; LED deactivated |
| ![static](/assets/led/static.gif) | powered on; normal        |
| ![slow](/assets/led/slow.gif)     | startup; warning          |
| ![fast](/assets/led/fast.gif)     | resetting; error          |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Default config

To reset the settings, hold down the button and connect the ESP to the power supply. As soon as the LED flashes quickly, the settings are reset.

| Setting        | Value              |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| TYPE           | WiFi AP            |
| SSID           | ChaosDMX-‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°      |
| PASSWORD       | mbgmbgmbg          |
| IP-Address     | 192.168.4.1        |
| DMX1 (Left)    | OUTPUT; Universe 1 |
| DMX2 (Right)   | INPUT; Universe 2  |
| LED Brightness | 10 %               |
